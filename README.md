# Food-Fusion-Platform
 A social media website where users can create posts about their recipes to share to other users. Users can also create comments under another user's post about their recipe. Users will be able to follow other users too. The website could also include an 'explorer' page where users can find out new recipes that is not in their feed.

 ## Conflict Resolution
 In the event of a conflict or disagreement among group members, we will vote on a decision to be made. The option with the majority of votes will be the one that we choose.

## Decision Made
| # | Area | Decision | Alternative | Rationale |
| --- | ---| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | IDE | VS Code | IntelliJ, Eclipse | The team is most familiar with this code editor. Additionally, VS Code supports multiple languages outside of Java which gives us more flexibility with our design choices. The speed and simplicity are also factors. |
| 2 | Dependency Management | Maven | Gradle | Maven is more familiar to the team and offers a much more user-friendly experience. Gradle has extensive features that would be difficult and unnecessary for this project. |
| 3 | Code | Lombok, Spring Security or similar | Writing Template Code | We have written basic template code in many of our prior courses - it would be repetitive and not add to our learning. Avoid wasting time on simple things and put it toward adding more features |
| 4 | Configuration Management | Yaml | Properties, Environment Variables | More concise and human readable than other options. Groups is relatively unfamiliar but can use this as an opportunity to learn it. |
